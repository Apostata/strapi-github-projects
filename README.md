# Strapi plugin github-projects

This plugin allows you to generate "Projects" from your Github repositories to your strapi admin panel. This plugin is for showing your projects on your portfolio website.  This plugin was a result of a step by step from [Udemy- The Complete Strapi Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/strapi-course/).

## Installation

`npm i strapi-plugin-github-projects` or `yarn add strapi-plugin-github-projects`


## Usage
In order to use this plugin you will need to generate a new personal Github token. After that, you will need to add it to your strapi admin project, environment variables at `.env`. The variable name should be `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
